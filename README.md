# KuCoin Crypto Lending 1.0 USDT Tracker
This bot records loan bids available on KuCoin's 1.0 Crypto Lending platform. I was inspired to make this because the earning potential was remarkable. It was a crypto-collateralized short-term lending market for stablecoins that was often at 25%-35% APR, and sometimes over 100% APR in bull markets. There were underlying risks, such as the potential for collateral shortfalls, platform security, and the common USDT FUD; however, the product itself had a good economic basis in that there were paying customers (perpetual futures traders), it was denominated in the most popular stablecoin USDT, collateral coins were whitelisted, and there was a collateral shortfall insurance fund. I started collecting this data when the market turned bearish, which is why the rates shown are somewhat lower. KuCoin has discontinued this product, so any data recorded now shows 0% APR. They launched a 2.0 version of this product called Kucoin Lending Pro but it requires 700K USDT minimum deposit.

The bot is written in Google Apps Script and can be deployed attached to a Google Sheet. For easy visualization of the spreadsheet data, a chart in Google Sheets can be made, but it is recommended to use Google Looker Studio or other third party graphing tools for better scaling.
